1. HTML elements have a hierarchical structure relationship; there are parents, siblings, children, children of children, etc. Explain each of these terms and the meaning of these relationships.

Parents: When a html tag has another html nested within it, the nested tag can be considered a child of the html tag it lies within. When setting up an unordered list <ul> the list items <li> tags that are under it are the child tags and the <ul> their parent.

Siblings: In the above setting, other <li> tags in that nested group would be siblings to each other sharing the same <ul> parents.

Children: As above, the <li> elements are the children of the parent elements. 

Children of Children: Now, give one of the <li> tags above a paragraph <p> that <p> is the child of the <li> its sits within. It is also now a grandchild or (child of another child element) to the <ul> tag.
