        <!-- Here are some basic html tags -->

        <h2>Examples of html tags:</h2>

        <p>Paragraphs can have <strong>Strong</strong> text.</p>
        <p>They can also <em>Emphasise</em> text.</p
        <div>
          Div's are used everywhere in web sites, they are prolific and serve an importan pupose for dividing a web page into sections.

        </div>
        <section>
          A more semantic method is to use the <code><section></code> tag.
        </section>

          HTML has had a life-span of roughly seven years. During that time, it has evolved from a simple language with a small number of tags to a complex system of mark-up, enabling authors to create all-singing-and-dancing Web pages complete with animated images, sound and all manner of gimmicks. This chapter tells you something about the Web's early days, HTML, and about the people, companies and organizations who contributed to HTML+, HTML 2, HTML 3.2 and finally, HTML 4.

          <p>
            The above examples of html are used all over the internet, a recent example is when booking a flight. Apart from some more complex backend code, and some API calls using JavaScript and most likely jQuery. There is a fair amount of basic html when inputing form fields like "passenger name", select fields to indicate how many passengers. <code><Section></code> and <code><div></code> tags divide up the page into a more logical design. And headings give explanations as to what that part of the site is asking. Images and icons are used throughout to add to the design and clarification.
